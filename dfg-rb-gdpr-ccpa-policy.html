<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>DfG-RB GDPR / CCPA Policy, Consumer protection, a.k.a. "Use / Rights Policy" </em></h2>

<p>Days for Girls Rancho Bernardo (DfG-RB) is a local chapter of the greater Days for Girls International (DfGI).
Both DfG-RB and DfGI value the privacy of our supporters' personal information and is committed to protecting it.
This policy is for DfG-RB relative to the legislation for GDPR and CCPA.  There are 2 other policies, privacy policies which are and umbrella to this GDPR / CCPA Policy, they are the "Days for Girls International" (DfGI) Privacy Policy as: <br>
linked here(1):&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>

<a href="dfg-rb-privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" onclick="localStorage.setItem('readpolicy10', 'clicked');"><strong><em>DfG-RB Privacy Policy</em></strong> </a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This GDPR / CCPA Policy is specific to DfG-RB, and its related implementation of website and electronic data collection, storage, processing, deletion/removal, destruction, user-rights, and user-protections. (most specifically User Data).
DfG-RB collects, uses, processes, stores the following data items which are of the personal User Data:
First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone Number, and several choices of personal interest and connections.
Additionally, DfG-RB collects an age category for each submission.
There is no right or wrong answer value for age category, the form submission is accepted for all answers.  The idea is to get minor individuals to answer honestly; and not decline them nor force them to lie.
Different age brackets have their own unique User Protections based on the users age and legislation.
Not seen by the user, but also collected, is a timestamp for each submission, a full string of the entire set of attributes/items in the submission form, and a signature key which verifies the submission did originated from the DfG-RB website.
Also collected, but not associated to any user is web browser history across our different Dfg-RB web pages (to help us better tune and adjust our web pages and the users web experience). Similarly, certain features which the user clicks or data-entries may be recorded locally (via localStorage, or IndexedDB, or Cache-Storage) in the users device/browser. This allows repeat use visits to perform better for that user, as the users device remembers some of the previous activities already accomplished. DfG-RB does not have any direct knowledge of these intermediaries. (the users computer/device/browser does...everything stays local; and not transmitted down the wire/backbone/web-system).

Based on the collected data/attribute set, DfG-RB may install a small web cookie via the Users Browser on the Users Device.  All cookies will be DfG-RB, as no 3rd party cookies are used/installed. No tracers or web-beacons. DfG-RB oviscaptes (hides/scrambles/cloaks) the cookies which limits any 3rd party from scraping the cookie for data for meaning value, or making profiles of you by tracking your habits, or selling that information to 3rd parties without your consent (there's nothing of habits or data value in our cookie(s)).
Note: Sometimes the idea of cookies generates fear, or possible mistrust, or invasion. These DfG-RB cookies are not of that type, just the inverse is true. DfG-RB would rather have the Users device store the sensitive User data, rather than open vulnerabilities on the DfG-RB side to save/shield/protect that data from being hacked. Similar to why DfG-RB doesn't directly take your donations; but rather passes that request onto a major service, DfG-RB doesn't really want your sensitive data, DfG-RB just wants to use it or verify it in a transitory manner, just leaving the data on the Users device.  The User can always view their cookie-data (or LocalStorage, IndexedDB, Cache-Storage) via their web-browser as browser-built-in function(s).
With that being said; DfG-RB small amount (all) transacted data is encrypted across the wire, and likewise what data that is store by DfG-RB is also encrypted.
...Protected in motion, Protected at rest when on DfG-RB machines.
Additionally, if the User submitted a "Subscription" request, DfG-RB may install some small cookie(s) onto the users device.  The cookies help the User experience and allow "push" messages to be sent to/into the User's device, or User's Notification system, or User's Calendar system, or the User's Text messaging system. [This primary a smart phone device feature, but could also work for users desktops/tablets if they're so configured (rare) (as this requires a texting phone number or sms number) ].
Upon "signing-up" or choosing the "subscription" (aka Joined) allows individuals access to additional protected web-pages (primarily the group contacts list). Protected pages are reserved/restricted, allowing access to individual's computers/devices whom have explicitly joined. Permission/Denial-Rejection is checked upon attempted entry, so if even coming via a search-engine link, only qualified joined individual's computers/devices are granted access.(Certain Local web-page links are revealed).<br>

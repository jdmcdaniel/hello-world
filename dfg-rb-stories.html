	<h1><em>...Stories, Scope, History Snippets</em></h1>
    <h2>Days For Girls volunteers are organized into local Chapters</h2>
	<h3>DfG Rancho Bernardo (DfG-RB) is Now a New local chapter</h3>
	<p> Days for Girls began as a volunteer-run organization. What began in November 2008 as a small yet passionate group of women (and some men!) has rapidly grown into a robust network of more than 50,000 volunteers around the globe. </p>
	<p>Chapters and Teams consist of volunteers who gather together, or work independently, to promote our mission in many ways. Most sew and assemble the DfG Kits, focusing on either complete DfG Kits or specific components from the DfG Patterns. Groups range in size from one to hundreds! No matter what aspect of the Days for Girls mission a group focuses on, they are all vital and important to our movement.</p>


<h2>Days For Girls, Rancho Bernardo San Diego, CA (DfG-RB), Making a Positive Difference</h2>

<p>Located in San Diego North County, DfG-RB started informally 2018, and organized formally in 2019 as a non-profit, and located themselves in the Ranch Bernardo community. This is the second chapter in North County, the first being the Escondido Chapter. The primary focus for the DfG-RB is to work with deploying the Feminine Hygiene product and education to the country of Ghana in West Africa.</p>
<p>The arrangement with Ghana is that inside that country they have their own enterprises working also fulfill the same mission. Using local Ghana personnel, enterprises, and educators is the best, healthiest outcome/deployment for any charitable cause</p>

<h2>The Big Mission; Keep Girls staying in Educational School</h2>	
<p>The current reality is that girls miss school when its their monthly "Period".<br>
Occurring month after month, girls fall behind. After several years of lagging, they just drop out.  Girls using Feminine Hygiene products have a decrease in absentee rates by 7x. Absenteeism falls from 38% to 5% when Feminine Hygiene products are used. </p><br>

<h2>Understanding the DfG-Kits</h2>
<p>Many local communities are providing outreach efforts for assembling Days For Girls Feminine Hygiene Kits.  These outreach groups organize sewing locations, many at churches. The full kit is outlined in the image below. DfG has strict rules on how the kits are to be sown and assembled; as their testing has tweaked the quality so that the kits can last 3 to 5 years. As an example, the strict rules require the quality of using a four cone serger, not a three cone!!! Lesser sergers will not qualify so in terms of performance quality, or cutout dimensions for waterproof shield portions, or the materials for washing and drying and packaging; these standards are spelled by the international days for girls. As such DfG has Branded it’s layout and materials selection, and sewing rules; and maintains a positive Brand identity with their Branded Products.

<h2>Understanding the Overview for DfG-RB</h2>
	   
<h3>The formulation of Rancho Bernardo Day for Girls, San Diego North County</h3>
	<p>The local community outreach in Rancho Bernardo for Days For Girls is just getting started on the web. Setting a website as part of the infrastructure to run its local chapter.  This outreach will organize the setting up of the sewing locations, setting up home volunteering, and the local community group meetings for formalized what previously been done as help for many churches.  This coordinating is not limited to sewing groups, but there are many needs beyond; like, for kitting the kits, packing and counting the kits; to weighing and shipping the product to Ghana.  Because of the enterprises in Ghana, DfG-RB may only produce a select set of components which contribute to being a full kit, with the remainder being supplied in Ghana, ... employing Ghana personnel. Sometimes the components are shipped, sometimes flown with other people traveling to Ghana. DfG-RB adheres to standards, materials selection, and sewing rules spelled out by DfG, yielding Brand identity with kits which can last 3 to 5 years.     </p>
<h3>Next Steps for Local Volunteering, Joining San Diego North County DfG-RB</h3>
	<p>		
If you would like to help join on with this local chapter the Rancho Bernardo chapter please see the link for signup or the link for donate, or join our sewing activities; which occur maybe twice a month for about 3 hours.  You could also do sewing at home on your free for our time if that schedules out better. So, it’s not a Big commitment but a very meaningful commitment a meaningful; to aid in helping other young women; to make the world better place helping young girls in school; and maybe break a cycle of dropouts (which then causes other problems and disadvantaged issues). Or you can donate and support the materials needed for the concept of local Ghana enterprises, which in time may take over 100% of this work.  Many positive styles of volunteering can contribute. The goal is to have these Enterprises take over the 100%, as their materials and labor are far cheaper than coming from the USA. It’s a process, a process of education on many levels; please help in these processes by volunteering.
